		All scripts used for Nationstates should be used at the users own risk. Even the most legal of
		scripts can be run improperly and thus become illegal. Please make sure you read any code that
		you use or put your nation's name into as a user agent. Do not use any code that was given to
		you by people you do not know or trust even if it is created by someone you know. If you do not
		know how to read code talk with the developer of the code to make sure that you understand what
		the code is doing it is your responsibility to abide by scripting rules. And you should read
		them they are located here (https://forum.nationstates.net/viewtopic.php?p=16394966#p16394966).

		With many farming scripts it is important to remember you need to press the key yourself to
		trigger all events this means you can not just hold the button down. You also can not put a rock
		or other object on the key to press the button for you.
