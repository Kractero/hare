		All scripts used for Nationstates should be used at the users own risk. Even the most legal of scripts can be run
		improperly and thus become illegal. Please make sure you read any code that you use or put your nation's name into
		as a user agent. Do not use any code that was given to you by people you do not know or trust even if it is created
		by someone you know. If you do not know how to read code talk with the developer of the code to make sure that you
		understand what the code is doing it is your responsibility to abide by scripting rules. And you should read them

		With many farming scripts it is important to remember you need to press the key yourself to trigger all events this
		means you can not just hold the button down. You also can not put a rock or other object on the key to press the
		button for you.
