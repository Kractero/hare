There are many ways to manage puppets, such as using keybinds to switch between nations or other management tools. One of the most effective methods, especially for card farming, is through the use of the extension Containerise.

### What is a container?

A container is an isolated instance within a browser, with its own cookies, sessions, and state, separate from other sessions or tabs. This means that for NationStates, you can configure multiple containers to be logged into different accounts simultaneously.
