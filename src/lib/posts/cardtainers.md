<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cardtainers/" target="_blank">Cardtainers</a> is a Firefox extension designed to simplify the management of containers specfically for NationStates.

Instead of manually generating container rules every time you create a new puppet, Cardtainers automates this process. It allows you to input a list of puppet names into a textarea when you click the extension icon. The extension then matches the URLs for `/nation=` and `/container=` for each nation, either creating a new container or using an existing one to open the tab.

Use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cardtainers/" target="_blank">Cardtainers</a> if you want to avoid the hassle of generating container rules repeatedly, especially if you're frequently creating new nations.

## Differences

With Cardtainers, you no longer need to manually generate container rules. Simply paste a list of your puppets into the textarea under the extension toolbar button, formatted like:

```plaintext
kazakhstan
norway
puppet farmer1
```

Cardtainers will handle the rest, making your workflow more efficient and less tedious.
